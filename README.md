# Web_Practice
Random things brought together to learn about and put into practice web dev things.

For this file, I started following some books on web design, first doing hmtl and css, then a second one on javascript

Things may be random or disorganized, cause I was just figuring things out and putting stuff in.

One thing I found out is that if I am to do a real page, and for my next attemp, is to break down and really organize the html beforehand and plan out what I want to do, with different sections and divisions.
This attempt is just random things that looked cool in the book that I wanted to try out and play with.
